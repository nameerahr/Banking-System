# Banking-System

This is a simulation of an online banking system using Java, that can be used in the terminal. You must initially create an account, but once it is
created, you can log in at anytime using the account ID that you are provided with on account creation and your password. Inside your account, you can
perform actions such as deposits/withdrawls, viewing/editing account information, creating a new credit account, accessing an existing credit account, or
completely deleting your bank account. Within your credit account there is additional functionality of making purchases, transfering funds into your 
credit account, paying your bill, viewing your credit information and deleting your credit account. All of your account information and account history 
is stored in 2 JSON files even upon exiting your session.
